/// A simple in-memory trie node structure that stores ASCII-based words and associated payloads.
///
/// This node supports:
///   - Insertion of words, storing a payload at the final node.
///   - Finding an exact word, retrieving its stored payload if it exists.
///   - Collecting payloads from every node along the path of a given word.
///
/// Typical usage involves creating a root `TrieNode` and inserting words:
///
///     let root = TrieNode()
///     root.insert(word: "apple", payload: [100, 101])
///     root.insert(word: "app",   payload: [50])
///
/// Then you can:
///
///     let exactPayload = root.find(word: "apple")      // -> [100, 101]
///     let allPayloads  = root.collectPayload(word: "apple") // -> [ (root payload?), 50, 100, 101 ]
///
/// Once you've built up your trie, you can optionally flatten it into a more compact structure
/// (e.g., `ByteArrayTrie`), or serialize it, etc.
