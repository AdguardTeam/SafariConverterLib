# Safari Converter Lib

This is a library that provides a compatibility layer between
[AdGuard filtering rules][adguardrules] and
[Safari content blocking rules][safarirules].

## General Code Style & Formatting

1. Use standard Swift formatting and style guidelines.
2. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
3. When writing class and function comments, prefer `///` style comments. In
   this case, you should use proper markdown formatting.
4. When writing inline comments, prefer `//` style comments.
5. In the case of comments, try to keep line length under 80 characters. In the
   case of code, it should be under 100.
6. Avoid comments on the same line as the code; place them on a previous line.

## Contribution Instructions

You MUST follow the following rules for EVERY task that you perform:

- You MUST verify the code with linter, formatter, compiler: `make lint`
    and fix all the issues that are found.

- You MUST run tests: `make test` and make sure that all tests pass.

- After adding new functionality or changing existing one, you MUST
    add unit tests for new code and verify/update existing tests.

- When changing user-facing behavior (e.g. supported rule types,
    conversion options, CLI flags), you MUST update `README.md`.

- When changing the directory structure, adding/removing modules, or
    altering public APIs, you MUST update `AGENTS.md`.

### Building

Run `make init` to setup pre-commit hooks.

- `make build` — builds JS and Swift code (debug).
    - `make swift-build` — builds the Swift package.
    - `make js-build` — builds the extension library code.
- `make release` — builds JS and Swift (release).

### Linting

- `make lint` — runs **all** linters.
    - `make md-lint` — runs markdown linter.
    - `make swift-lint` — runs swift linters ([SwiftLint][swiftlint],
      [swift-format][swift-format], and [periphery][periphery]).
    - `make js-lint` — lints JS extension code.

### Testing

- `make test` — runs **all** tests.
    - `make swift-test` — runs Swift tests.
    - `make js-test` — runs JS tests.
    - `make filelock-test` — runs file lock test suite.
    - `make command-line-wrapper-test` — runs command-line wrapper test suite.

### Performance Tests

All benchmark tests use `XCTest.measure` unless noted otherwise.
Each test's doc comment contains historical wall-clock baselines per
machine — update them after profiling on your hardware. When you
change core conversion logic, run all performance tests and compare
the results against the baselines. Add a new dated baseline entry
to the corresponding test if the numbers shift noticeably.

Performance test files:

- `Tests/ContentBlockerConverterTests/ContentBlockerConverterPerformanceTests.swift`
- `Tests/FilterEngineTests/FilterEngineSerializationTests.swift`
- `Tests/FilterEngineTests/Utils/ByteArrayTrieTests.swift`
- `Tests/FilterEngineTests/Utils/TrieNodeTests.swift`

Running performance tests: `make test-performance`. Follow the
instructions in `scripts/perf/README.md` for the full procedure
(gathering system info, running tests, updating baselines).

You MUST run performance tests after any changes to files under
`Sources/` that could affect runtime behavior.

When adding or changing performance tests, you MUST update the
test list in `scripts/perf/README.md` accordingly.

## Code Organization

### ContentBlockerConverter

The public API is provided by the `ContentBlockerConverter` class and its
public `convertArray` function.

Internally, it parses string lines using `ContentBlockerConverter/Rules/*`
classes and discards the lines that cannot be parsed.

After that the rules are transformed into Safari content blocking rules by
`Compiler`.

- `/Sources/ContentBlockerConverter` — converter library code. It is
  responsible for converting [AdGuard rules][adguardrules] to Safari
  content blocking rules and advanced blocking rules. "Advanced rules"
  are AdGuard rules that cannot be directly converted to Safari syntax
  and should be interpreted using JS by a browser extension.

### CommandLineWrapper

- `/Sources/CommandLineWrapper` — command-line interface code. It is
  responsible for providing a command-line interface to the converter
  library.

### FilterEngine

The public API is provided by two classes:

- `WebExtension` — the class that is supposed to be used by web
  extensions. It covers all the important use cases:

    - Building and serializing the filtering engine (see
      `buildFilterEngine`) to a location shared between the main app
      process and the extension's process.
    - Looking up for the set of filtering rules that should be applied
      to the specified page (see `lookup`). This method also implicitly
      deserializes the filtering engine.

- `FilterEngine` — provides the low-level API for building, serializing
  and deserializing the filtering engine, a class that interprets AdGuard
  rules and is capable of performing all the operations very quickly.

### Extension

Please refer to [Extension/README.md][extension] for details on how code
is organized there.

### FileLockTester

- `/Sources/FileLockTester` — file lock tester code. It is responsible
  for testing file lock functionality. The library uses `FileLock` class
  for distributed locking functionality. Unfortunately, to test it we
  have to create a separate helper app.
